# Complete PSU Control System

This system provides comprehensive control of high-voltage power supplies through multiple interfaces: direct Python scripting, web services, and LabVIEW integration. It supports both single and dual PSU operation.

## üîå Physical Setup Overview

### What You Need:
1. **High-voltage power supplies** (Heinzinger 30kV/2mA and/or FUG 50kV/0.5mA)
2. **Custom USB interface boards** ("Analog PSU Interface" boards, VID: 0xA0A0, PID: 0x000C)
3. **Raspberry Pi 4** (or any computer with USB ports)
4. **USB cables** to connect interface boards to computer

### How It's Connected:
```
[Heinzinger PSU] ‚Üê‚Üí [USB Interface Board #1] ‚Üê‚Üí [USB Cable] ‚Üê‚Üí [Raspberry Pi USB Port]
[FUG PSU]        ‚Üê‚Üí [USB Interface Board #2] ‚Üê‚Üí [USB Cable] ‚Üê‚Üí [Raspberry Pi USB Port]
                                                              ‚Üì
                                                      [Your Control Software]
```

### What the Interface Boards Do:
- Convert USB commands to analog control signals (0-10V)
- Read voltage/current measurements back from PSUs
- Control output relay (on/off switch) for each PSU
- Each board appears as a separate USB device with the same VID/PID but different device indices

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

### Layer 1: Hardware Interface (C++)
- **Low-level USB communication** with interface boards
- **16-bit DAC control** for precise voltage/current setting
- **ADC reading** for voltage/current measurement
- **Safety checks** and error handling

### Layer 2: Python Bindings (PyBind11)
- **Bridge between C++ and Python** using PyBind11
- **Compiled module**: `heinzinger_control.so` (built from C++ code)
- **Python classes**: Expose C++ functionality as Python objects

### Layer 3: Python Control Modules
- **Direct PSU control** for scripting and automation
- **Multi-PSU management** for handling multiple devices
- **Web service layer** for remote HTTP/JSON control

### Layer 4: User Interfaces
- **Direct Python scripts** for custom automation
- **REST API service** for LabVIEW and web interfaces
- **Mock services** for testing without hardware

## üìÅ Complete File Guide

This section explains every single file in the system, what it does, when to use it, and how it works with other files.

### üîß Core Hardware Interface Files

#### `bindings.cpp` - The Bridge Between C++ and Python
**What it does:**
- Creates Python bindings for the C++ PSU control classes
- Uses PyBind11 to expose C++ functions to Python
- Defines the `HeinzingerPSU` class that Python can import

**Technical details:**
- Compiles into `heinzinger_control.so` (the actual Python module)
- Maps C++ methods like `set_voltage()` to Python callable functions
- Handles data type conversion between C++ and Python

**When it's used:** Automatically when you import the compiled module in Python

**You don't need to modify this** unless you want to add new C++ functions to Python

---

#### `Heinzinger.cpp` + Headers in `headers/` folder - The Low-Level Control
**What it does:**
- Contains the actual C++ code that talks to USB interface boards
- Handles USB communication, DAC/ADC operations, and safety checks
- Implements the `HeinzingerVia16BitDAC` class used by Python

**Technical details:**
- Uses libusb for USB communication
- Converts voltage/current values to DAC register values
- Reads ADC values and converts them back to voltage/current
- Handles USB packet checksums and error codes

**When it's used:** Automatically when Python calls PSU functions

**You don't need to modify this** unless you're changing hardware protocols

---

### üêç Python Control Modules

#### `run_psu_multi.py` - The Modern Multi-PSU Engine
**What it does:**
- **Core module** for controlling one or multiple PSUs
- Manages multiple PSU instances with different device indices
- Handles module loading, initialization, and cleanup
- **Recommended for all new scripts**

**Key functions:**
```python
# Get a PSU instance (creates if needed)
psu = get_psu_instance(device_index=0, max_v=30000, max_c=2.0)

# Control functions
psu.set_voltage(1000.0)      # Set voltage
psu.set_current(1.0)         # Set current limit  
psu.switch_on()              # Turn output on
volts = psu.read_voltage()    # Read actual voltage
amps = psu.read_current()     # Read actual current
relay_on = psu.is_relay_on()  # Check if output is on
```

**When to use:**
- Writing new Python scripts to control PSUs
- Need to control multiple PSUs (device_index=0, 1, etc.)
- Want the most flexible and modern interface

**Example usage:**
```python
import run_psu_multi as psu

# Control Heinzinger (device 0)
heinz = psu.get_psu_instance(device_index=0, max_v=30000, max_c=2.0)
heinz.set_voltage(5000)

# Control FUG (device 1)  
fug = psu.get_psu_instance(device_index=1, max_v=50000, max_c=0.5)
fug.set_voltage(10000)
```

---

#### `run_psu.py` - The Original Single-PSU Module
**What it does:**
- **Legacy module** originally designed for one PSU
- Now updated to support multiple PSUs but maintains backward compatibility
- Has built-in interactive command-line interface
- **Still perfectly usable** for single PSU control

**Key features:**
- Interactive mode: run `python3 run_psu.py` for command-line control
- Commands: `setv 1000`, `setc 1.5`, `on`, `off`, `read`, `quit`
- Legacy functions for existing scripts

**When to use:**
- Quick interactive testing of a single PSU
- You have existing scripts that import `run_psu`
- You want a simple command-line interface

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Interactive mode
python3 run_psu.py
# Then type: setv 1000, on, read, off, quit

# Or import in scripts (legacy style)
import run_psu
run_psu.setup_module_path_and_load()
run_psu.initialize_psu()
run_psu.set_psu_voltage(1000)
```

  - Turn on: `POST /fug/relay` with `{"state": true}`

## Testing

### Without Hardware
```bash
# Start the service (will show initialization errors but endpoints will work)
python dual_psu_service.py

# In another terminal, run the test script
python test_dual_psu.py
```

### With Hardware
1. Ensure both USB interface boards are connected
2. Start the service: `python dual_psu_service.py`
3. Check status: `curl http://localhost:5000/status`
4. Test individual PSUs:
   ```bash
   # Heinzinger
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/heinzinger/set_voltage -d '{"value": 1000}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   curl http://localhost:5000/heinzinger/read
   
   # FUG
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/fug/set_voltage -d '{"value": 2000}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   curl http://localhost:5000/fug/read
   ```

## Safety Features

- **Range Validation**: Each PSU enforces its specific voltage/current limits
- **Independent Control**: PSUs operate completely independently
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for communication failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues to work even if one PSU fails

## Configuration

### PSU Specifications
Edit `dual_psu_service.py` to modify PSU configurations:

```python
PSU_CONFIGS = {
    "heinzinger": {
        "device_index": 0,
        "max_voltage": 30000.0,  # 30kV
        "max_current": 2.0,      # 2mA
        "max_input_voltage": 10.0,
    },
    "fug": {
        "device_index": 1,
        "max_voltage": 50000.0,  # 50kV
        "max_current": 0.5,      # 0.5mA
        "max_input_voltage": 10.0,
    }
}
```

### Debug Mode
Set `verb=True` in the `get_psu_instance()` calls for detailed C++ logging.

## Troubleshooting

### USB Device Detection
```bash
# Check if USB devices are detected
lsusb | grep "a0a0:000c"

# Should show two devices if both boards are connected
```

### Service Logs
The service prints initialization status and errors. Check console output for:
- "PSU initialized successfully" messages
- USB connection errors
- Module loading issues

### Common Issues
1. **"Module not found"**: Ensure the C++ module is built in the `build/` directory
2. **"USB device not found"**: Check physical connections and device enumeration
3. **"Permission denied"**: May need udev rules or elevated privileges for USB access
4. **Port conflicts**: Ensure port 5000 is available or change in the service

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue - "Unable to claim USB interface 1" (FIXED)**
**Error:** `Error: Unable to claim USB interface 1. Libusb error: Entity not found. [-5]`

**Root Cause:** This was a critical bug in the C++ USB interface claiming logic where `device_index` was incorrectly passed as the USB interface number instead of the device skip count.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** in the current codebase. If you encounter this error, ensure you have the latest `Heinzinger.cpp` with the corrected `OpenDevice()` call.

**Technical Details:** The fix changed `OpenDevice(VID, PID, device_index)` to `OpenDevice(VID, PID, 0, device_index)` to properly specify USB interface 0 for all devices.

### üíª **Platform Differences - Mac vs Raspberry Pi**

**Issue Discovered:** The dual PSU system works differently on Mac vs Raspberry Pi due to USB subsystem differences.

**Mac Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Both PSUs initialize in any order
- ‚úÖ More permissive USB resource sharing
- ‚úÖ Better USB driver isolation
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple libusb contexts gracefully

**Raspberry Pi Behavior:**
- ‚ùå Device 1 fails if initialized after Device 0
- ‚ùå Stricter USB resource management
- ‚ùå USB contexts don't release properly between devices
- ‚úÖ Works if Device 1 (FUG) initialized FIRST

**Root Cause:** Pi's USB subsystem doesn't fully release libusb resources when the first device cleanup occurs, causing "Resource busy" errors for the second device.

**Universal Solution:** Initialize devices in this order on both platforms:
1. **Device 1 (FUG) FIRST** - needs clean USB state
2. **Device 0 (Heinzinger) SECOND** - more tolerant of used USB state

**Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING** on both Mac and Pi with unified initialization order.

## Migration from Single PSU

If you're migrating from the original single PSU system:

1. **LabVIEW Changes**: Update base URLs from `http://pi:5000/` to `http://pi:5000/heinzinger/` or `http://pi:5000/fug/`
2. **JSON Format**: No changes needed - same JSON structure for all endpoints
3. **Backward Compatibility**: The original `run_psu_service.py` can still run independently for single PSU operation

## üêõ **CRITICAL BUG FIX - Dual PSU USB Issue RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Second device failed with `Error: Unable to claim USB interface 1. Libusb error: Entity not found. [-5]`

**Root Cause:** In `Heinzinger.cpp` line 42-43, `device_index` was incorrectly passed as the USB interface number instead of device skip count.

**Fix:** Changed `OpenDevice(0xA0A0, 0x000C, device_index)` to `OpenDevice(0xA0A0, 0x000C, 0, device_index)`

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Both PSUs now initialize and control simultaneously.

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Dual PSU USB initialization bug fixed
2. ‚úÖ **WORKING:** Test the system on your Mac with both interface boards
3. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Copy working files to your Raspberry Pi  
4. ‚úÖ **WORKING:** Test with actual hardware - both PSUs initialize successfully
5. Update your LabVIEW program to use the new endpoints:
   - Heinzinger: `http://pi_ip:5001/heinzinger/*`
   - FUG: `http://pi_ip:5001/fug/*`
6. Enjoy simultaneous control of both PSUs! üéâ

**System Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** on both Mac and Raspberry Pi
