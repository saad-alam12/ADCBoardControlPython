Dual PSU Service - Web API for Controlling Two Power Supply Units

This Flask web service provides HTTP endpoints to control two different types of
high-voltage power supplies (PSUs) used in scientific/industrial applications.

What This Service Does:
- Provides a REST API to control PSUs via HTTP requests
- Manages two PSUs simultaneously with different capabilities
- Handles safety limits and error checking for all operations
- Offers both individual PSU control and system status monitoring

Supported PSUs:
1. Heinzinger PSU (USB path @00110000):
   - High voltage: up to 30,000 volts (30kV)
   - Low current: up to 2 milliamps (2mA)
   - Manual operation: no remote relay control
   - API endpoints: /heinzinger/*

2. FUG PSU (USB path @00120000):
   - Higher voltage: up to 50,000 volts (50kV)
   - Lower current: up to 0.5 milliamps (0.5mA)
   - Remote control: has relay for on/off switching
   - API endpoints: /fug/*

Common Use Cases:
- Laboratory automation for high-voltage experiments
- Remote control of power supplies for safety
- Automated testing of electrical equipment
- Scientific research requiring precise voltage/current control

Safety Features:
- Voltage and current limits enforced by software
- Input validation for all parameters
- Error handling and reporting
- Graceful shutdown procedures

How to Use:
1. Start the service: python dual_psu_service.py
2. Service runs on http://localhost:5001
3. Use HTTP requests to control PSUs (see individual endpoint documentation)
4. Check /status for system overview
5. Visit / for API documentation

Technical Notes:
- Built with Flask web framework
- Uses run_psu_multi.py for hardware communication
- Supports concurrent access to both PSUs
- JSON request/response format
- Thread-safe operations

Example Quick Start:
curl http://localhost:5001/status  # Check if PSUs are working
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/fug/set_voltage -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 1000}'
curl http://localhost:5001/fug/read  # Read current voltage/current

def get_psu_instance(psu_type):
    """
    Gets a PSU controller instance for the specified PSU type, creating it if needed.
    
    This function acts like a "PSU manager" - it keeps track of which PSUs are
    already set up and ready to use, and creates new connections when needed.
    Think of it like getting a remote control for a specific TV - if you already
    have the remote, it gives you that one; if not, it sets up a new remote.
    
    This is an internal helper function used by all the HTTP endpoints to ensure
    they have a working PSU connection before trying to control the hardware.
    
    Args:
        psu_type (str): Which PSU you want to control. Must be either:
                       - "heinzinger" for the Heinzinger PSU (30kV/2mA, no relay)
                       - "fug" for the FUG PSU (50kV/0.5mA, with relay)
    
    Returns:
        object: A PSU controller instance that can be used to control the hardware
                Returns None if the PSU type is invalid or initialization fails
    
    What This Function Does:
        1. Checks if the requested PSU type is valid (heinzinger or fug)
        2. Looks up the PSU's configuration (voltage limits, USB path, etc.)
        3. If PSU is already initialized, returns the existing controller
        4. If PSU is not initialized, attempts to create a new controller
        5. Stores the controller for future use if initialization succeeds
    
    PSU Configuration Details:
        - Each PSU has different voltage/current limits for safety
        - Each PSU uses a specific USB path for reliable hardware identification
        - Configuration is defined in the PSU_CONFIGS global dictionary
    
    Error Handling:
        - Returns None for invalid PSU types
        - Returns None if PSU hardware is not connected/available
        - Catches and logs all exceptions during initialization
        - Prints helpful error messages for troubleshooting
    
    Example Usage (internal):
        psu = get_psu_instance("fug")
        if psu is not None:
            voltage = psu.read_voltage()  # Now safe to use PSU
        else:
            return error_response("FUG PSU not available")
    
    Thread Safety:
        - Safe to call from multiple HTTP requests simultaneously
        - PSU instances are stored globally and reused
        - Initialization only happens once per PSU type
    
    Notes:
        - This is an internal function - users interact via HTTP endpoints
        - PSU instances persist for the lifetime of the web service
        - Failed initialization attempts are not retried automatically
        - Uses run_psu_multi.py for actual hardware communication

        - Voltage may be slightly different from set value due to load or PSU accuracy
        - "on" field is always false because Heinzinger has no remote relay control

    HTTP Endpoint: Set voltage for FUG PSU
    
    Sets the output voltage of the FUG PSU to a specific value.
    The FUG PSU can output very high voltage (up to 50,000V) with very low current (up to 0.5mA).
    Unlike the Heinzinger PSU, the FUG PSU supports remote relay control for turning output on/off.

    Parameters:
        value (number): Desired voltage in volts
                       Must be between 0 and 50,000 (50kV maximum)
                       Can be integer or decimal (e.g., 2500, 10000.5)
    
    Response (JSON):
        Success (200): {"ok": true}   - Voltage set successfully

    Safety Notes:
        - FUG PSU can output VERY high voltage (50kV) - extremely dangerous
        - Voltage is applied immediately when command succeeds
        - Always ensure proper safety procedures and equipment isolation
        - Consider using relay control to safely enable/disable output
        - PSU hardware may have additional safety interlocks
    
    Comparison with Heinzinger:
        - FUG: Higher voltage (50kV vs 30kV), lower current (0.5mA vs 2mA)
        - FUG: Has remote relay control (Heinzinger does not)

    What Current Limiting Does:
        - Critical safety protection for high-voltage applications
        - PSU will automatically reduce voltage if load draws too much current
        - Prevents damage to sensitive circuits from overcurrent
        - Even tiny currents can be significant at very high voltages
        - Does not control actual current flow (that depends on the load)
    
    Safety Notes:
        - ALWAYS set appropriate current limits before connecting loads
        - At high voltages, even 0.5mA can be dangerous
        - Current limiting is essential for protecting sensitive equipment
        - Consider starting with very low limits (0.1mA) and increasing as needed
    
    Comparison with Heinzinger:
        - FUG: Much lower maximum current (0.5mA vs 2mA)
        - FUG: Better suited for high-voltage, ultra-low-current applications
        - FUG: More precise current control for sensitive measurements

        on (boolean): True if relay is ON (power can flow), False if relay is OFF (no power)
    
    Example Usage:
        # Read current PSU status

    Understanding the Values:
        - voltage: What the PSU is actually outputting right now
        - current: How much current the connected load is actually drawing
        - on: Whether the internal relay allows power to flow
    
    Key Differences from Heinzinger:
        - FUG "on" field reflects actual relay state (Heinzinger always shows false)
        - FUG can show 0V/0mA when relay is off, even if voltage is set
        - FUG provides true remote monitoring of power output state
    
    Use Cases:
        - Verify that voltage/current settings were applied correctly
        - Monitor current draw to ensure it's within safe limits
        - Check if PSU is actually outputting power (relay state)
        - Confirm safe shutdown by verifying relay is off
        - Troubleshoot connection or load issues
    
    Safety Monitoring:
        - Always check "on" status before working on connected equipment
        - Use this endpoint to verify safe shutdown procedures
        - Monitor current to detect unexpected load changes
        - Verify voltage is at expected levels during operation
    
    Notes:
        - Readings are real-time from PSU hardware
        - If relay is OFF, voltage/current should be near 0 regardless of settings
        - Current value depends on what's connected (0 if nothing connected)
        - Voltage may be slightly different from set value due to load or PSU accuracy
    
    Common Issues:
        - "FUG PSU not available" - Hardware not connected or initialized
        - Very low current readings might indicate poor connections
        - Voltage significantly different from set value might indicate PSU issues
        - "on" false when expecting true suggests relay control problems

    What Happens When Relay Changes:
        - ON â†’ PSU immediately starts outputting power at set voltage/current
        - OFF â†’ PSU immediately stops all power output (voltage drops to 0)
        - Settings (voltage/current limits) are preserved when relay changes
        - Hardware safety interlocks may still prevent operation
    
    Safety Best Practices:
        - Always set voltage and current limits BEFORE turning relay ON
        - Turn relay OFF before making any connection changes
        - Verify relay is OFF before maintenance work
        - Use this as emergency stop capability
        - Monitor relay state during automated operations
    
    Error Handling:
        - If PSU rejects the command, "ok" will be false in response

    Use Cases:
        - System health monitoring and dashboards
        - Verify both PSUs are properly initialized
        - Quick overview of current operating conditions
        - Troubleshooting PSU connection issues
        - Automated system checks before operations
        - Safety verification (check relay states)
    
    Initialization Status:
        - "initialized": true = PSU is connected and ready for commands
        - "initialized": false = PSU not connected or initialization failed
        - If not initialized, voltage/current/relay_on fields will be missing
    
    Error Handling:
        - If a PSU is initialized but reading current values fails, an "error" field is added
        - Individual PSU errors don't affect the other PSU's status
        - The endpoint always returns HTTP 200 with available information
    
    Monitoring Best Practices:
        - Use this endpoint for periodic health checks
        - Check "initialized" before attempting PSU operations
        - Monitor "relay_on" for safety verification
        - Watch "current" values to detect unexpected load changes
        - Compare "voltage" with expected set values
    
    Technical Notes:
        - Reads from both PSUs simultaneously
        - Non-blocking operation - doesn't affect PSU settings
        - Configuration values (max_voltage, max_current) are from PSU_CONFIGS
        - Current readings are real-time from hardware

    Properly shuts down and releases all PSU resources during service shutdown.
    
    This function ensures that all PSU connections are properly closed and
    memory resources are freed when the web service shuts down. It's crucial
    for preventing resource leaks and ensuring PSUs are left in a safe state.
    Think of it like properly closing all connections before turning off a computer.
    
    What This Function Does:
        1. Calls run_psu.cleanup_psu() to release all hardware connections
        2. Sets all PSU instances to None in the global PSU_CONFIGS
        3. Prints status message for debugging
        4. Ensures clean shutdown without resource leaks
    
    When This Function Is Called:
        - Automatically when the web service exits normally
        - When the service receives termination signals (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM)
        - During error shutdowns to ensure cleanup
        - Can be called manually if needed
    
    Safety Features:
        - Safe to call multiple times (idempotent)
        - Doesn't affect PSU hardware settings, just software connections
        - Ensures no hanging processes or memory leaks
        - Prints confirmation message for verification
    
    What Happens to PSUs:
        - Software connection to PSUs is closed
        - PSU hardware remains in its last configured state
        - Voltage and current settings are preserved on the hardware
        - Relay states are maintained (FUG PSU)
        - Physical PSU operation is not affected
    
    Technical Details:
        - Uses run_psu.cleanup_psu() from the PSU control module
        - Clears global _psu_instances dictionary
        - Resets PSU_CONFIGS instance references to None
        - Registered with multiple shutdown handlers for reliability
    
    Example Situations:
        - User presses Ctrl+C to stop the service
        - System administrator sends SIGTERM signal
        - Service crashes and needs emergency cleanup
        - Manual service restart or maintenance
    
    Notes:
        - This is a safety function - always better to call it than not
        - PSUs can be reconnected by restarting the service
        - Hardware will remember its settings between service restarts
        - Essential for proper resource management in production
