    Sets up and loads the special code needed to control PSU hardware.
    
    This program controls PSUs (Power Supply Units) using code written in C++
    for better performance. Before we can use that C++ code from Python, we need
    to load it like loading a library book from a specific shelf.
    
    This function does three main things:
    1. Tells Python where to find the C++ code file (in the 'build' folder)
    2. Checks that the code file actually exists there
    3. Loads the C++ code so Python can use it
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if everything loaded successfully, False if something went wrong
    
    What This Function Does:
        - Adds the 'build' folder to Python's search path
        - Looks for the compiled C++ module file (ends in .so on Linux/Mac)
        - Imports the C++ code so other functions can use it
        - Prints helpful messages about what's happening
        - Sets a flag so we know the module is ready to use
    
    Common Problems:
        - "Build directory not found" = The C++ code hasn't been compiled yet
        - "Module file not found" = Compilation failed or file was moved
        - "Failed to import" = The compiled code has missing dependencies
    
    Notes:
        - Safe to call multiple times (won't reload if already loaded)
        - Must be called before using any PSU control functions
        - The C++ code file is created by compiling with cmake and make

    Turns ON the electrical output of a specific PSU device.
    
    A PSU (Power Supply Unit) is like an electrical switch that can be turned on or off.
    When OFF, it produces no electricity even if voltage/current are set. When ON,
    it actively supplies electricity at the configured voltage and current levels.
    
    This function is like flipping a light switch to the "ON" position - it enables
    the PSU to start supplying power to whatever is connected to its output terminals.
    
    Args:
        device_index (int): Which PSU you want to turn on (like PSU #0, PSU #1, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the PSU was turned on successfully, False if something went wrong
    
    Side Effects:
        - PSU begins supplying electricity at its configured voltage/current settings
        - Connected devices/circuits will receive power and may start operating
        - PSU status indicators may change (LEDs, displays, etc.)
    
    Safety Warning:
        - Make sure all connections are secure before turning on the PSU
        - Verify voltage and current settings are appropriate for connected devices
        - Be aware that connected devices will immediately receive power
    
    Example:
        # First set up the PSU with safe settings
        initialize_psu(0, max_v=5000, max_c=1.0)  # 5V, 1A max
        set_psu_voltage(0, 3300)  # Set to 3.3V
        set_psu_current(0, 0.5)   # Limit to 0.5A
        switch_psu_on(0)          # Now turn it on - power flows!
    
    Notes:
        - PSU must be initialized first using initialize_psu()
        - Configure voltage and current BEFORE turning on for safety
        - Use switch_psu_off() to turn off the power output

def switch_psu_off(device_index):
    """
    Turns OFF the electrical output of a specific PSU device.
    
    This function stops the PSU from supplying electricity, like turning off a light
    switch. Even though the PSU is still connected and configured, no power flows
    to connected devices until you turn it back on with switch_psu_on().
    
    Think of it as the "emergency stop" or "safe shutdown" for the power supply.
    The PSU remembers its voltage and current settings, but stops outputting power.
    
    Args:
        device_index (int): Which PSU you want to turn off (like PSU #0, PSU #1, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the PSU was turned off successfully, False if something went wrong
    
    Side Effects:
        - PSU stops supplying electricity immediately
        - Connected devices/circuits lose power and may shut down
        - PSU status indicators may change (LEDs, displays, etc.)
        - Voltage and current settings are preserved for next time
    
    Safety Benefits:
        - Safe way to cut power without unplugging cables
        - Protects connected devices during connection changes
        - Allows safe adjustment of settings while power is off
    
    Example:
        switch_psu_off(0)  # Turn off PSU #0 - power stops flowing
        # Now safe to change connections or settings
        set_psu_voltage(0, 5000)  # Change voltage while safely off
        switch_psu_on(0)   # Turn back on with new settings
    
    Notes:
        - PSU must be initialized first using initialize_psu()
        - This is the safe way to stop power output
        - PSU settings (voltage, current limits) are not changed, just output disabled
        - Always turn off before making connection changes

def is_relay_on(device_index):
    """
    Checks whether a specific PSU's internal relay/switch is currently ON or OFF.
    
    A relay is like an internal electrical switch inside the PSU. When the relay is ON,
    the PSU can supply power to its output terminals. When the relay is OFF, no power
    flows even if the PSU is configured and "switched on" - it's like having a second
    safety switch inside the device.
    
    Think of it like checking whether a circuit breaker is in the ON or OFF position.
    This function asks the PSU "is your internal power switch currently on?"
    
    Args:
        device_index (int): Which PSU you want to check (like PSU #0, PSU #1, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the internal relay is ON (power can flow)
              False if the internal relay is OFF (no power output) or if there's an error
    
    Example:

    Common Use Cases:
        - Safety check before connecting sensitive equipment
        - Troubleshooting why a PSU isn't supplying power
        - Verifying PSU state before making measurements
        - Confirming proper shutdown after switch_psu_off()
    
    Notes:
        - PSU must be initialized first using initialize_psu()
        - This is a read-only check - it doesn't change the relay state
        - Returns False if PSU communication fails (safer assumption)
        - Relay state may be different from the main on/off switch state

def cleanup_psu(device_index=None):
    """
    Properly shuts down and releases PSU resources to prevent memory leaks.
    
    When you're done using PSU devices, it's important to "clean up" - this means
    telling the computer to release the memory and resources that were being used
    to control the PSUs. It's like closing a program properly instead of just
    unplugging the computer.
    
    This function can clean up either one specific PSU or all PSUs at once.
    
    Args:
        device_index (int, optional): Which PSU to clean up (like PSU #0, PSU #1, etc.)
                                    If not provided (None), cleans up ALL PSUs
    
    Returns:
        bool: Always returns True (cleanup is generally safe to attempt)
    
    Side Effects:
        - Removes PSU instances from internal memory
        - Frees up computer resources used for PSU control
        - PSU hardware may remain in its last configured state
        - After cleanup, you'll need to initialize again to use the PSU
    
    Example:
        # Clean up just PSU #0
        cleanup_psu(0)
        
        # Clean up all PSUs
        cleanup_psu()  # or cleanup_psu(None)
    
    When to Use:
        - At the end of your program before exiting
        - When switching to a different PSU configuration
        - If you encounter errors and want to start fresh
        - As part of proper "shutdown" procedures
    
    Notes:
        - Safe to call even if PSU wasn't initialized
        - Safe to call multiple times
        - Doesn't change PSU hardware settings, just releases software control
        - Good programming practice to always clean up resources
